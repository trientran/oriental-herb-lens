    <string name="about_us">Med Herb Lens is a non-profit project that utilises Artificial Intelligence
        (Deep Learning - Tensorflow) to assist medicinal herbalists and traditional healers and physicians in automatically
        recognizing and classifying medicinal plants.
        \n\nThis project was initiated and has been led by Mr. Minh Le, a Doctor of Traditional Medicine
        student from Thanh Dong University, Vietnam. He helped build the dataset and also assisted in evaluating
        the authenticity of the input data.
        \n\nIn consultation with Mr Le, this Android app has been developed by Mr Trien Tran as part of his Master of Information Technology degree\'s capstone thesis project. He is now an alumnus
        of St. Paul University Philippines. If you are an iOS developer and willing to join us voluntarily, please reach out via the contact button.
        \n\nAs of now, the developed AI model can recognise only 70 herbal plants due to limited input data (to view the list of these 70 ones, please press the button at the end of this dialog). Therefore, we look forward to expanding the number of recognised medicinal plants to almost 4000.
        This ambition will not be achieved without your support. There are 2 ways you may help us out:
        \n\n- Please contribute to the dataset by capturing your own herb images using your own mobile and camera devices,
        then upload them all to our server using this mobile app.
        \n\nThe image quality does not matter, meaning that it is OK to set the lowest image resolutions for your camera. You may take photos in both portrait and horizontal modes, in different environments with different brightness (night vs day, indoor vs outdoorâ€¦).
        \n\nWe need details such as fruits, blossoms, branches, leaves, roots, and whole plant, both fresh and sun-dried ones, if possible.
        \n\n- And can you please also help us fill in all the herbs\' details such as usage, side effects, drug interactions etc.? To do this, please browse or search using our search bar to look for the herbs that you are familiar with or have information about. Then you can click on the edit buttons to modify those details at your own convenience.
        You can also find the full list herbal plants that already exist in our database by clicking the Full Herb List button below.</string>

    <string name="how_to_take_photos">This app does not support capturing photos yet. Please use a camera app to take photos. The image quality does not matter when it comes to regular smartphones and cameras, meaning that it is OK to set the lowest image resolutions for your devices\' cameras, to save storage. However, we don\'t recommend photos taken in an artistic or selfie mode.
    \n\nIt is your choice to take the photos in either portrait or horizontal mode or both, in different environments at different angles or corners with different brightness (night vs day, indoor vs outdoorâ€¦). The more the better though ^_^.
    \n\nWe need details such as fruits, blossoms, branches, leaves, roots and whole plant, both fresh and sun-dried ones, if possible because diversity does matter ^_^. Generally, at least 50 images for each part of the plant should suffice for our AI model to learn. We limit the maximum of photo intakes to 1000 per herb.
    \n\nThe rule of thumbs is, if you have taken a photo of a known herb but you are unable to say the name of the plant in that photo, our AI model should not be either ^_^.
